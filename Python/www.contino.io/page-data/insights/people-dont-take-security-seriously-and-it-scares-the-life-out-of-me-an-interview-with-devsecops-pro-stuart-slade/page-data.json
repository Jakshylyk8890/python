Hurrah!”. But already they’re vulnerable! The default build for a VPC is a single public subnet with the default security group, which opens it up to the whole world. It’s up to the user to control those permissions and adjust them accordingly before doing anything, but people simply don't do this. They’ll build an instance there and won’t secure it, patch it, protect it, or put firewall controls on it.

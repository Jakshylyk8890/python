Only one assessment area (Continuous Integration) scores above 5 (a 6.5 on average). The rest are 5 or below, painting a worrying picture for enterprises that are increasingly feeling the pressure to accelerate their digital innovation capability.\n\nThe technology arena scores higher than people or process, pointing to a common (but problematic) bias toward trying to fix problems first with technology, rather than dealing with the messier areas of culture, processes and skills. Skills, in particular, score poorly across the board.\n\nThe lowest scoring assessment area is security and DevSecOps. It seems that security remains an ‘afterthought’, considered only at the end of the software delivery cycle, rather than being embedded at every stage as per DevOps best practice. Given the ever-rising tide of breaches and hacks, this is an area that needs immediate attention.\n\nThe results also suggest that even where DevOps practices have been implemented structurally (e.g. cross-functional teams), silos still exist between Dev and Ops, as well as between engineering and InfoSec. This suggests that these DevOps practices have been imposed from the top-down, with the bottom-up cultural elements lagging behind (hence the stubborn silos). The result is that, ultimately, respondents report that DevOps is currently not delivering what it is supposed to: "},{"_key":"235c74741de47","_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"secure code!"},{"_key":"235c74741de48","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"\n\nThere are, however, also promising signs that a solid foundation is in place.

They concentrate on one (almost always technology), forget the others and then fail. It’s at this point that they realize that reading the books and articles wasn’t enough. What they actually need is a hand from someone who has done this before.\n\nIt’s worth noting that respondents strongly disagreed with the assertion that they had anyone on their team who had prior DevOps experience (they gave an average score of 1). Such experience is crucial to be able to spot the various gaps, identify any functional silos within the organization and decide how best to move toward product-focused and cross-functional teams. The technology part comes with locating the gaps in automation, i.e. identifying what’s still being done manually and eliminating those inefficiencies, in so far as is feasible.\n\nOvercoming the silos is crucial. Here, setting incentives that are more business-driven is critical because it helps teams think the right way. For example, imagine that there are a number of siloed teams: database, cloud engineering, release management, etc. All these teams should be incentivized toward a common business goal, rather than only thinking about their own silo. This also gets teams talking to each other, as reaching that common business goal involves different teams.\n\nLastly, crucial for all of the above is finding the right people that have the right mindset, skillset and the willingness to change and working with them closely.\n\nTo self-assess your own DevOps maturity, visit

Futurist, Ray Kurzweil, predicted that a computer would beat a human at chess by 2000 (it happened in 1997) and he predicted that a computer will pass the Turing test by 2029, so true AI is likely around 10 years away. The key is that we need to bring together many branches of technology to enable true AI, and advance them significantly for them to pass the Turing test.

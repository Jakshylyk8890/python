However, many QA departments still use a bevy of manual runbooks to drive important chunks of this testing, further slowing down releases and increasing pressure on QA engineers. If all of those runbooks were done during the pipeline, and if that pipeline were written as code, then developers can spend less time waiting on QA by running QA tests during the local development process, and QA can spend more of their time helping developers write better tests.

Within a year, engineers who had been deploying infrastructure via traditional methods in the cloud had to upskill and adapt their mindsets and attitudes to deploying resources whilst also transitioning skills to typically what a developer would do. For some this was overwhelming and not everyone learnt at the same pace, bearing in mind that other technologies and characteristics in the cloud were also evolving at the same time.

Sometimes it’s OK to learn as the customer does—or a little bit before them. It would be easy for a cloud engineer to see this as another insurmountable topic and technology set to master, potentially leaving space for impostor syndrome to creep in, but know that working practices like DevSecOps are ever-evolving and require you to constantly refresh and update your knowledge.

You might just have got your head around Consul, when all of a sudden your manager informs you that you need to implement code security testing into the pipeline, using static application security testing (SAST).

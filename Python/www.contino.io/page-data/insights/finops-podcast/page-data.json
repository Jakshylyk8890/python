Communication and clear processes–-ideally automated ones—allow you to flag, investigate and predict rising spends, gradually working to become more proactive rather than reactive.

A tool on its own isn’t enough and can be pricey, so it’s vital to make sure that if you’re investing say, 2% of your annual cloud spend on a tool, that it isn’t cheaper to first seek out expert advice from companies like Contino to ensure you first address underlying issues and aren’t—somewhat ironically—adding unnecessary costs in an attempt to cut them.\n"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"a970c0936806","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"fbfb5e24bdd5","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"As well as tools, consider what people and processes you have in place.

AI has completely revolutionised the way we work, interact and go about our lives. Modern data science is no longer about researching breakthrough AI, but focusing on solving business problems with existing tools and proven algorithms. From manufacturing to marketing, AI is increasing productivity and streamlining business operations.\n\nIn an increasingly crowded marketplace, business leaders are looking to AI-driven solutions for an edge over their competition. However, many businesses adopting AI lack the key ingredients of strategy, operating model and execution framework necessary for achieving business-wide AI adoption.\n\nAn AI strategy outlines how the technology will achieve set business objectives and, more importantly, identify AI assets that grant the business a competitive advantage and are difficult for competitors to replicate.\n\nNow that we know what an AI strategy is, here are some tips to create the right one for your business, align your organisation and effectively execute.\n\n"},{"_key":"3ae1b432cc27","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"1.

Once complete, the strategy can be easily escalated down into divisional- or even product-level strategies.\n\n"},{"_key":"53bad1be295f1","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"2.

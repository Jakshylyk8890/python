Running multi-cloud Terraform requires an engineering investment, developing the replication of the desired state with the target cloud providers resources as each cloud provider has their own ‘provider-specific’ Terraform resources.

It of course takes into account each platform’s dependencies and manages them for you, leaving you to focus on just the infrastructure you need.

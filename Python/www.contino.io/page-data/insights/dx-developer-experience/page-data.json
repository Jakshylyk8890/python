Some of these tools and services might force password expiration, meaning the need to update passwords periodically. They likely force a log out after a specified period of time, meaning the need to provide usernames, passwords, and MFA again. This can be further exacerbated by the use of desktop-as-a-service services such as Citrix desktop, which, again, requires periodic authentication and another place to re-log in to all the systems you need to use.

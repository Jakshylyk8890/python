We found visibility to be one of the most difficult problems we encountered in the project. We had a large number of clusters without much insight into the current (or desired) state of the clusters. Due to these visibility issues, we decided to implement ArgoCD to facilitate Continuous Deployment and develop some GitOps automation to automate the administration of the cluster, with the idea that GitOps would help with the visibility issue. We had multi-tenant clusters with multiple development teams using each cluster, which meant the basic administration of a cluster, in this case, involved creating namespaces, network policies and role bindings. We started with this administration process, which was well-defined so we could deliver value quickly. It was vital in creating automated environments for developers and allowed us to see them in Git and change them later if (or when) requirements around the environments changed. The initial development gave us buy-in to the ideas and feedback on the implementation and let us upskill others in the team so they could contribute to the system. Socialising and helping build these ideas means teams can develop the skills to use GitOps throughout their work and create an automated, robust system.

From a technical point of view, the pipeline acts as the interface, which should stay mostly the same.

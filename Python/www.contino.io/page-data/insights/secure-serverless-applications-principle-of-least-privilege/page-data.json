An example of an attack on availability would be a “denial of service” attack whereby an attacker overwhelms your application and stops it from running because it simply can't service the number of requests that are being made to it. In the serverless world, this kind of attack is more often known as a “denial of wallet” attack because serverless applications are so scalable that they can still service a very high number of requests, but at the end of the month (or whenever your billing period is) you'll get a huge bill because you've been using a lot of resources to serve those request. A breach of availability is generally known as "},{"_key":"9666628361ac1","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"destruction"},{"_key":"9666628361ac2","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"7c3e37e5f180","_type":"imageArticle","asset":{"_id":"image-1ecc47b4dc0b99df6802f3bab17df1532bace3ca-1756x782-png","_type":"sanity.imageAsset","_rev":"8SDHIiWIpXQWSUhZGp139J","_createdAt":"2022-08-11T13:43:44Z","_updatedAt":"2022-08-11T13:43:44Z","assetId":"1ecc47b4dc0b99df6802f3bab17df1532bace3ca","extension":"png","metadata":{"_type":"sanity.imageMetadata","blurHash":"M2SF;L00~q%M_3M{-;~qj[%M~q_3IU%M%M","dimensions":{"_type":"sanity.imageDimensions","aspectRatio":2.2455242966751916,"height":782,"width":1756},"hasAlpha":true,"isOpaque":true,"lqip":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAJCAYAAAAywQxIAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAABD0lEQVQokXVQWa6DMAzs/e/HQ0JIgNj3nbAlrsatSyvxPiZ24vFk7Mc8z1QUBaOuK6qqivMsyxh5nvMdUSB84TVNQ/u+kzGGHhDEY5qmH1KSJBSGISOOY0rThKMAdUEURdyzrutLEMrjODKWZWEMw0B1XTOQo9b3PefTNDG6rqO2bfkdPcdxvASRgAgC3ALI4Ro/i6B8ADGlFAsBSik6z5O01pdD7CUIAh6nLEsGVoCIJuzI931yHIdHFKfiTGt9CW7bRlEUkmVZZNs2N8gYqKEBDrFP13X5U0whQsYYxo9DkP4si0U9z2MH32Rw4Ej2fCf2EcT8sjMZEw5kL//hrs6COFA8z+MdL+Kdg7v7N54ln7KXKS/eoQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","palette":{"_type":"sanity.imagePalette","darkMuted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#353535","foreground":"#fff","population":1.49,"title":"#fff"},"darkVibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#424242","foreground":"#fff","population":0,"title":"#fff"},"dominant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#353535","foreground":"#fff","population":1.49,"title":"#fff"},"lightMuted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#c0c0c0","foreground":"#000","population":1.07,"title":"#fff"},"lightVibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#bcbcbc","foreground":"#000","population":0,"title":"#fff"},"muted":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#7c7c7c","foreground":"#fff","population":0.51,"title":"#fff"},"vibrant":{"_type":"sanity.imagePaletteSwatch","background":"#7f7f7f","foreground":"#fff","population":0,"title":"#fff"}}},"mimeType":"image/png","originalFilename":"Screenshot 2022-08-09 at 13.44.46.png","path":"images/hgftikht/production/1ecc47b4dc0b99df6802f3bab17df1532bace3ca-1756x782.png","sha1hash":"1ecc47b4dc0b99df6802f3bab17df1532bace3ca","size":521257,"uploadId":"lhFdgpACQLRl8b76HvaDWzW8AjqyodHH","url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/hgftikht/production/1ecc47b4dc0b99df6802f3bab17df1532bace3ca-1756x782.png","id":"image-1ecc47b4dc0b99df6802f3bab17df1532bace3ca-1756x782-png","parent":null,"children":["3347d02a-6a9c-5e9f-be74-c4fb259712e8"],"internal":{"type":"SanityImageAsset","contentDigest":"5a2ed25253ee7019da292d1a4df6f3e2","counter":1601,"owner":"gatsby-source-sanity"}}},{"_key":"982587a7b814","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"b5f70e0f4f430","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"A "},{"_key":"b5f70e0f4f431","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"risk"},{"_key":"b5f70e0f4f432","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" generally relates to a beach of one of more of these security properties—confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

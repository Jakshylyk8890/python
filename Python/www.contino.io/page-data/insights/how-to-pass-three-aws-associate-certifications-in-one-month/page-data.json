Sometimes, you will hesitate between more options that you can pick. I personally find it useful to start by checking all the answers and then proceed by elimination by unchecking the wrong answers until you are left with only plausible ones. If you still end up with more answers than you should, the elimination process allows you to focus on the most likely answers without having to keep track of the distractors."}],"level":1,"listItem":"bullet","markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"78b36b4b9131","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"10865e4b69b20","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The new version of the exam takes 135 minutes to answer 65 questions.
